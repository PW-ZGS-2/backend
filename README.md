# SkyShareAPI

SkyShareAPI is a FastAPI-based web service that allows users to manage and interact with telescopes remotely.

Additionally, it includes endpoints to view the status of telescopes and get detailed specifications.

## Features

- **Add a Telescope**: Users can add new telescopes with their specifications and location information.
- **Update a Telescope**: Users can update existing telescope details.
- **Delete a Telescope**: Users can delete a telescope from the system.
- **Get Telescope List**: Retrieve a list of available, reserved, and unavailable telescopes.
- **Get Telescope Details**: Get detailed specifications for a specific telescope.
- **Lock Telescope**: Lock a telescope for a userâ€™s session to begin observing.
- **Periodic Cleanup**: Clean up unused telescopes periodically by checking if any are idle (not being used) for a certain period.
